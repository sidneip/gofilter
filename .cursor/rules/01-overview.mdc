# GoFilter Library Overview

GoFilter is a generic library for dynamically and flexibly filtering slices of structs in Go.

## Project Purpose
This library fills a gap in Go's standard library by providing a way to filter slices of structs with:
- Dynamic field selection
- Multiple filter conditions
- Access to nested fields
- Composable filter operations

## Usage Pattern
GoFilter is designed to be used by creating filter conditions and applying them to slices:
1. Import the filter package
2. Define your data structures
3. Create filter conditions using operators like `Equals`, `Gt`, `Contains`
4. Compose filters with `And`, `Or`, `Not`
5. Apply filters to your data
